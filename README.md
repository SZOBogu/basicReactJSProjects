# basicReactJSProjects

It contains 5 trivial projects from ReactJS:
  - Vote counter: you hit one button and counter increases, you hit another counter decreases.
  - Authenticator: Login form checking hardcoded credentials. You get different message depending on success of authorization. Uses hooks.
  - Routing: you have 3 components with their addresses, and you can move accross those. Uses react-router-dom.
  - Book info getter: sends request to https://wolnelektury.pl/api/books/ to get info about the book and show it to you. Uses axios.
  - List of meme exercises: list of names, random explanations and how much you bench. You can add to it via form. Uses context.
  
Purpose of these is to have something working from which I can shamlessly copy in the future projects.
